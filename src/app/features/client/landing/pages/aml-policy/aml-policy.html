              </p>

              <h2>Verification Procedures</h2>
              <p>
                Platform establishes its own customer verification procedures within the standards
                of AML/CFT frameworks.
              </p>
              <p>

                with customer, client, contractor.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the process of due diligence and KYC and in order to open an account, person’s
                identity, information about a person provided and documents submitted have to be
                verified and checked against sanctions and watch lists, including PEP list. Platform
                uses special tools, structured system of verification and check for that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regarding legal entities (their owners/shareholders/beneficiaries, etc.), Platform
                carries out special enhanced due diligence, KYC, compliance procedures.
              </p>
              <p>

                procedure for customers referenced as PEP, whatever their place of residence.
              </p>

              <h2>Monitoring, risk assessment and risk-based approach</h2>
              <p>
                The Compliance Officer conducts investigations for incoming and outgoing
                transactions based on various factors, including the security system for automatic
                verification of transactions, the specified verification time period takes up to 24
                hours. Platform carries out customer’s transactions monitoring, risk‐assessment and
                suspicious activity detection. For that purpose it uses specially developed system,
                including using a high-performance tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                Platform uses risk-based approach to combating/preventing money laundry and/or
                financing terrorism.
              </p>
              <p>
                To assist in determining the level of AML/CFT due diligence to be exercised with
                regard to the customer, a compliance risk profile is calculated first of all on
                entry into relations (Low, Medium, High), and is then recalculated routinely.
              </p>
              <p>
                AML/CFT compliance ensures that an ongoing transaction monitoring is conducted to
                detect transactions which are unusual or suspicious compared to the customer
                profile.
              </p>
              <p>
                Determination of the unusual nature of one or more transactions essentially depends
                on a subjective assessment, in relation to the knowledge of the customer (KYC),
                their financial behaviour and the transaction counterparty.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a transaction is inconsistent with a customer’s known personal usual activities
                or personal habits, this transaction may be considered suspicious. Data and
                transaction monitoring tools are used to identify unusual/uncommon patterns of
                customer’s activity. After review and investigation, it is Compliance Officer’s
                decision whether to file a SAR or not.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a SAR is filed with a relevant agency, a copy of filing documentation is
                maintained. SAR filing is confidential and only the Platform’s employees involved in
                the investigation and reporting process will be aware of its existence.
              </p>
              <p>
                All records are retained for no less than (5) years and are available upon official
                request by an authorized examiner, regulator, or law enforcement agency.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any Platform staff member must inform the Compliance Officer of any atypical
                transactions which they observe and cannot attribute to a lawful activity or source
                of income known of the customer.
              </p>

              <h2>AML audit</h2>
              <p>
                The Compliance Officer is responsible for conducting AML/CFT audit at least
                annually. Other audit demands are set in internal policies and procedures.
